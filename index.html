        <h1>What is the Quanta Challenge?</h1>
        <p>
          The Quanta Challenge is a thrilling competition designed to push your Math and Physics skills to the next level! 
          This is your chance to take what you already know and use it to crack more advanced and intriguing problems.
          The competition has two exciting phases. 
          Phase one is an online challenge that runs for three weeks. 
          Each week, we will post two tricky questions on our website for you to tackle. 
          Get them correct and you will unlock vital clues for the second phase! In phase two, get ready for hands on fun with practical Physics challenges. 
          Using the clues you have collected in phase 1, your team will complete experiments that will guide you to the final answer. 
          The first team to crack it will claim the ultimate bragging rightsâ€”and, of course, medals and trophies!
